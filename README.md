## Info
I made this project to extract the most likely action that a user could be referring to using an LLM. 

However, I made the amazing discovery that my code is completely useless. I thought it would be cool and that an LLM would be more efficient at understanding context, but it is in fact a million times more computationally expensive than training a NLP model. And the smaller models often get the action wrong. This project is **deprecated!**
